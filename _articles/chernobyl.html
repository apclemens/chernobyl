    <div style="width:30%;top:15vh;left:20vw;">The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, officially known as the V. I. Lenin Atomic Power Plant during the Soviet era, began construction in 1970 in a remote region near Ukraine’s swamp-filled northern border, 15 kilometers northwest of the small town of Chernobyl. The desolate location was chosen because of its relative proximity to (yet safe distance from) Ukraine’s capital, a ready water supply - the River Pripyat - and the existing railway line running from Ovruc in the west to Chernigov in the east.</div>

    It was the first nuclear power station ever to be built in the country, and was considered to be the best and most reliable of the Soviet Union’s nuclear facilities.

    To oversee the titanic operation, 35-year-old turbine expert and loyal communist Viktor Bryukhanov was plucked from his position as Deputy Chief Engineer at the Slavyanskaya thermal power station in eastern Ukraine, and appointed as Chernobyl’s Director. He's second from the left.

    Concurrent to the construction of the power station, the Soviet Union’s ninth Atomograd - Russian for ‘atomic city’ - named Pripyat was being erected 3 kilometers away, for the express purpose of housing the ambitious station’s 50,000 operators, builders, support staff and their families.

    These original architect's drawings portray Pripyat as a kind of utopia.

        Convincing experienced workers from more populous parts of the Soviet Union to move to such a remote location proved challenging, so many of Chernobyl's workers came straight from college/university. As a result, Pripyat was one of the ‘youngest’ cities in the Soviet Union, with an average age of only 26.

    <div style="width:20%;left:30%;top:15%;">
        Because Pripyat was new and carried with it the prestige of a nuclear power station, it was afforded many modern luxuries other Soviet cities sometimes did without.
